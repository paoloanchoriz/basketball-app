# springmvc-data-mongodb-tiles-thymeleaf-starter
A starter setup for Spring MVC integegrated with DataMongoDB, Tiles and Thymeleaf. Also have BootstrapJS and AngularJS in it.

This is a copy of some project I cloned here in Github, but I made some changes due to personal preferences. For instance,
I want to work with Tiles and Thymeleaf when it comes to templating and Spring Data Mongo DB for persistance.

This is still a work in progress and would soon fork this into another project. Although there are already sample domains,
it has nothing to do with the project setup besides being test domains when I setup Spring Data.
